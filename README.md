# WorkFlo

Employee Management System developed using PHP and MySQL.

WorkFlo provides a centralised platform to manage the operations and processes of a company such as its employees, departments, tasks, projects, and financials. 

WorkFlo is designed to be used by organisations of all sizes, with features that can be customised to meet the specific features of the organisation. The system will streamline operations and improve efficiency, leading to increased productivity and profitability. It will also provide valuable insights into organizational performance.

The employee logs in to the system using their unique login credentials. After logging in, they are directed to the dashboard, which displays the total number of employees, total number of leaves taken, total number of loans granted, current projects, and any notices from the admin. The employee can edit and update their personal information such as name, contact information, address, and emergency contact details.

The admin can add the attendance of employees and working hours and generate attendance reports.

The employee can apply for leave, view their leave balance, and the status of their leave application which will be reviewed and approved by the admin. 

The admin can assign projects to employees, and the employee can view the details of the project, deadlines, and progress.

The admin can manage the employee's payroll, including salary, tax deductions, bonuses and generate payslips through the system.

The admin can grant loans to employees, view their loan status, track loan history, and calculate loan repayments.

The admin can manage the assets assigned to employees, such as laptops, phones, company vehicles, and generate reports on asset and logistics usage.

The admin can post important notices and announcements on the notice board, which will be visible to all employees.

The employee can log out of the system after completing their tasks.
